# Omori-Steam-Page

I employed front-end development tools, specifically HTML and CSS, to design an interactive page for the popular videogame platform, Steam, and the game Omori. This replicated Steam page features interactive buttons and a navigation bar complemented by responsive animations, designed to emulate the aesthetic of a contemporary software application. This redesign aims to revamp the outdated user interface of the existing Steam page.
